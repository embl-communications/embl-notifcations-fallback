# embl-notifcations-fallback

In cases of major outages, it may not be possible to access or update the central embl notifications URL used by the `embl-notifications` component.

This repo provides a secondary URL that will always be checked: https://embl-communications.github.io/embl-notifcations-fallback/notifications.js

For guidance on formatting the notification, see the documentation at https://visual-framework.github.io/vf-core/components/embl-notifications/
